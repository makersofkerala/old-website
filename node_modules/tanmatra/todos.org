* TODOS
  
** Ability to preserve the traversal path on query or just focus on the leaf nodes
   

** Add the ability to acquire kv pairs using {name: "kv"} syntax?

{name: "?"} will return the value at "?" position.
Now if I give {name: "kv"}, it will return the entire map as {name: "David"}

** Better Validation
   
On setting a data using
t.s({fns: fns, completed: 0})

If the completed was not in the data definition, Tanmatra should throw an error saying that it didn't match the specified shape.

Also, when selecting an index beyond the bounds, it should warn the developer.


** Deferred Loading
   
Currently all the files are being loaded as lump sum. Make this a la
carte. Also better if you can denote if something should be
lazy/available always. This is a space vs. time trade-off.

** Ability to generate with the shape description
   
** Consider renaming the stores to nodes

** Computed values/views from data
   
** Storing History of the value changes

** May be an ability to diff between changes in the history?

** May be validate before entering data into localStorage?
   
** Tanmatra Dashboard to view the status of the store
